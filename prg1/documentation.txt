I choose the unordered_map to store information of stops and regions, and the key of stops is stop id and key of regions is region id

I choose unordered_map, because map is convenient to find the element with a key. And most operations in this project need to find id first,
and the performance finding algorithm of unordered_map is the most efficient, Thetha(constant). Additionally, performance of adding is also
Theta(constant). 

What's more, I have two unordered_maps (stops and regions), the key is corresponding id and value is a struct. In struct Stop, I have region ths stop
belongs to, and in struct Region, there are parent_region(pointer) and sub_regions(vector of pointer), stops(vector of pointer). So that, it's 
useful for me to get region according to stopid and get stop according to regionid. In other words, I connect regions and stops, and its subregions, 
parent_region via pointer and struct.
